[![Auth0](http://blog.auth0.com.s3.amazonaws.com/logo-290x200-letters.png)](http://auth0.com)

[Auth0](http://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Office365, Google Apps, Salesforce.

The Auth0 Login Widget makes it easy to integrate SSO in your app. You won't have to worry about:
* Having a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any resolution and device.
* Finding the right icons for popular social providers.
* Remembering what was the identity provider the user chose the last time.
* Solving the home realm discovery challenge with enterprise users (i.e.: asking the enterprise user the email, and redirecting to the right enterprise identity provider).
* Implementing a standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login)

## Example

The example directory has a ready-to-go app. In order to run it you need [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then execute `npm run example` from the root of this project.

## Usage

Take `auth0-widget.js` or `auth0-widget.min.js` from the `build` directory and import it to your page.

### Initialize:

Construct a new instance of the Auth0 Widget as follows:

~~~html
<script src="auth0-widget.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var widget = new Auth0Widget({
    domain:       'mine.auth0.com',
    clientID:     'dsa7d77dsa7d7', 
    callbackURL:  'http://my-app.com/callback'
  });
  
  // ...
</script>
~~~

### Show Widget:

Trigger the login widget as follows:

~~~html
widget.show({
  resources: { title: "Sign In with Auth0" },               // OPTIONAL: specify custom text for labels
  connections: ['contoso.com', 'facebook', 'google-oauth2'] // OPTIONAL: specify connections
});
~~~

## Develop

Run `npm run dev` and point your browser to `http://localhost:9999/` to run the test suite.

## Browser Compatibility
